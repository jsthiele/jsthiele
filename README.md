## Hey there!

### Here's a short introduction: 
Nice to e-meet you. I'm a PhD candidate in Indigenous and Rural Health at Montana State University. I'm new to GitHub. I primarily use R packages for Bayesian regression-based statistical modeling of health-related data, but I want to learn more about machine learning and how to combine that with Bayesian methods. I used to code more in undergrad (Biomed Engineering at the University of Michigan), and I want to get back into the coding world and apply that to my health research. Hence my foray into GitHub! 

### Long introduction if you want:

  I am a doctoral candidate in the department of Health and Human Development at Montana State University, studying towards my PhD in Indigenous & Rural Health. I focus on using mixed methods with participatory research approaches to identify and address disparities in mental and sexual and reproductive health. I use Bayesian data analysis to study factors quantitatively and am most proficient in using R statistical software. Qualitatively, I am most familiar with grounded theory and use inductive analysis to code qualitative data for emergent themes. 
  
  For my dissertation, I aim to understand the association between sexual risk behavior, mental health, and substance use while examining how protective factors moderate that association. I will use Bayesian methods to explore this association quantitatively using secondary data from an NIH R01 clinical trial that improved SRH for Indigenous youth. I will then engage in conversations with tribal research partners, youth, and a community advisory board to collaboratively interpret the quantitative results. I hope to contribute to the existing literature regarding sexual risk behavior for Indigenous youth in the US. I also aims to outline a culturally-relevant method that integrates quantitative analysis and community-based participatory research to inform future work that addresses sexual health disparities for Indigenous communities in the US.
  
  I am a previous Fulbright Student Researcher in San Salvador, El Salvador. Topics included: health access, human rights, forced internal displacement, migration, urban violence, urban health, invisible borders, humanitarian consequences, equity, global justice, global health, mHealth.
  
  Aside from academics, I practice as a saxophonist, synthesist, composer, and producer. I make electronic music that is influenced by house, techno, jazz, ambient, and experimental genres, blending together saxophone and other woodwinds with synthesizers and electronic rhythms.
